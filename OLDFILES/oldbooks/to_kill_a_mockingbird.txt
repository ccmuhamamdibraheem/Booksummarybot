To Kill a Mockingbird is a 1960 novel by Harper Lee, widely regarded as one of the most important works of modern American literature. Set in the racially segregated American South during the 1930s, the story is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. Scout’s father, Atticus Finch, is a principled lawyer who takes on the difficult case of defending Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Through Scout’s observations, the novel portrays the deeply ingrained racism of the time while also highlighting her own journey of moral growth, empathy, and understanding. Alongside the trial, the children—Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill—struggle to make sense of good, evil, and human behavior as they encounter mysterious neighbors like Boo Radley. The book explores themes of racial injustice, compassion, integrity, and the loss of childhood innocence. Its enduring legacy lies in its call for fairness, empathy, and courage in confronting prejudice.
