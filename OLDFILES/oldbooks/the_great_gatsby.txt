The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and enormously wealthy man who throws extravagant parties in New York during the Jazz Age of the 1920s. Beneath the glittering surface of champagne, music, and luxury, the novel explores themes of love, obsession, wealth, and the decline of the American Dream. Narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and veteran who rents a modest house next door to Gatsby’s mansion, the novel gradually reveals the truth about Gatsby’s life. Gatsby is hopelessly in love with Daisy Buchanan, a woman he met years earlier and who is now married to the arrogant Tom Buchanan. Gatsby’s fortune and glamorous lifestyle are driven by his obsessive hope that Daisy will leave Tom and return to him. As Nick becomes entangled in their lives, he witnesses the moral decay of the elite, the emptiness hidden behind wealth and status, and the destructive power of desire. The story builds toward tragedy, exposing the illusion of the American Dream and the cost of chasing an unattainable ideal.
